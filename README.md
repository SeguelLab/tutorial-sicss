# tutorial-sicss

### Purpose: Hands-on SICSS tutorial notebooks, will flip to public after polish

## 🌟 Overview

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

- Set up and use LLM agents through APIs (e.g., OpenAI, DeepSeek)
- Classify structured datasets using agents
- Conduct guided web search tasks with agent-based tools
- Customize prompts and manage API calls responsibly
- Understand practical use cases and limitations

This tutorial is designed for researchers with varying levels of coding experience. Some familiarity with Python or R is helpful, but not required.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourOrg/tutorial-sicss.git
cd tutorial-sicss

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # or venv\\Scripts\\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt


## 🔐 API Access and Privacy
This tutorial requires access to an LLM API (e.g., OpenAI, DeepSeek, etc.).

API keys will not be shared publicly.

We will explain how to store your key securely (e.g., using environment variables or secret management tools).

Please follow ethical guidelines and platform terms of service.

🧠 Learning Goals
By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:

Build basic LLM agents for data classification

Apply prompt engineering techniques

Automate web-based information retrieval

Reflect on the reliability, reproducibility, and ethics of these tools in research

📦 Extensions and Directions
We will also discuss how these techniques can be extended to:

Classifying and annotating your own research datasets

Supporting qualitative coding workflows

Searching across open-access archives or academic corpora
