            "\n",
            "2. **Books**: There are many books on artificial intelligence that can provide you with a solid foundation on AI agents. Some recommended titles are \"Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach\" by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig, and \"Artificial Intelligence: Foundations of Computational Agents\" by David L. Poole and Alan K. Mackworth.\n",

            "4. **Join AI Communities**: Join online forums, such as Reddit's r/artificial or Stack Overflow, where you can ask questions and learn from the experiences of others working with AI agents.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Hands-on Projects**: One of the best ways to learn is by doing. Consider working on some hands-on projects where you can apply what you've learned about AI agents. Kaggle is a great platform for finding datasets and participating in AI competitions.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Attend Workshops and Conferences**: Keep an eye out for workshops and conferences related to AI and AI agents in your area. These events are a great way to network with professionals in the field and stay up-to-date on the latest trends and technologies.\n",

        "In OpenAI's chat models (such as gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4), prompts are structured as a list of messages, each with a defined role: system, user, or assistant. This format allows for more natural and controlled interactions. The system message sets the behavior and tone of the assistant (e.g., \"You are a helpful assistant\"), while user and assistant messages simulate the back-and-forth of a conversation. Importantly, even though we provide multiple messages in the messages list, they are all sent together in a single API request. This structure does not mean we're sending multiple prompts or requests—it simply provides the model with context for generating one coherent response. Using this role-based approach allows the model to better understand instructions, follow conversational flow, and maintain context across turns."
