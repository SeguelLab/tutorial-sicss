        "In DeepSeek's models (such as deepseek-chat and deepseek-reasoner), prompts are structured as a list of messages, each with a defined role: system, user, or assistant. This format allows for more natural and controlled interactions. The system message sets the behavior and tone of the assistant (e.g., \"You are a helpful assistant\"), while user and assistant messages simulate the back-and-forth of a conversation. Importantly, even though we provide multiple messages in the messages list, they are all sent together in a single API request. This structure does not mean we're sending multiple prompts or requestsâ€”it simply provides the model with context for generating one coherent response. Using this role-based approach allows the model to better understand instructions, follow conversational flow, and maintain context across turns."
